       The web
     </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
       The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request to a server</em>. The server finds the appropriate <em>HTML</em> document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. The Web was invented in the 1990's and has about 30 Million Pages.

   <div class="concept-description">
             <p>
               when creating a webpage you add tags, these tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure of the page. each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. the closing tag always has a slash at the begining of it. Tags act like containers, they tell you something about the information that lies between the thier opening and closing tag. the word <b>"Element"</b> comprises the opening tag, closing tag and any contnt that lies between it.

                 programmers often describe computers as "stupid". when this is ssaid they arent insulting the computers. they are addressing a important point about how computers understand the instructions that humens programmers give them. computers sesitive to typos and how small mistakes can lead to huge problems when given to a computer

   <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
       attributes provide addtional information about the contents of an element. they appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a <b>Name</b> and a <b>Value</b>, sperated by an equals sign. the attributes <em><b>Name</b></em> indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the elements content. the <em><b>Value</b></em> is the information or setting for the attribute. it should be placed in double quotes.

                     when a Browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only shows one space. also if it comes across a line break it treats that as a single space too. unless specfied all line spaces or breaks collapse to one line.

  <div class="concept-description">
                     <p> 
                       Block elemements create invisible boxes which can have height/width. Block elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window, example of block elements are <b>(h1,p,ul,li,Div.)</b> Inline elements will appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements, examples of inline elements are <b> (a,b,br,em,img,span).</b>

    Tree like structure
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree.
        
        Structure is very important in helping navigate around the page.

    Boxes,Grids and Rules
    <div class="concept-description">
    <p>
      CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box(and content of that box)is presented. understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an indivisible box around every HTML element
      
      Using CSS you could add borders, specify Width/Height, and bacground color

        What is a text editor? A text editor is a program that helps you type text similar to document editors, such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, but without all the extra formatting functions that document editors have.
        
        Note that technically you could use a text editor like Notepad, TextEdit, etc... As long as your file names end in .html your browser will know to read them as HTML.

    Understanding CSS
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
        
        Specifics Matter-"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

    CSS styling in web pages methods
    <div class="concept-discription">
      <p>
        <b>Method 1:</b> write CSS in the <b>Head</b> of your HTML. To do this: 1. At the top of your HTML document, add a <b>Head</b> element. 2. Inside the <b>Head</b> element, add a <b>style</b> element. 3. Write your CSS in the <b>style</b> element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Method 2:</b> Link your HTML to a separate CSS file This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this: 1. Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html). 2. In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code. 3. Add a <b>head</b> element to the top of your HTML. 4. Add a <b>link</b> tag inside the <b>head</b> element. Since <b>link</b> is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing <b>/link</b>. 5. Add the following attributes to your <b>link</b>: * rel="stylesheet" * type="text/css" * href="main.css"
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Method 3:</b> Write your style inline with your HTML.This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it.With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individual HTML element
